Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation

The program takes a color image (PPM format) and produces a segmentation
with a random color assigned to each region.

1) Type "make" to compile "segment".

2) Run "segment sigma k min input output".

The parameters are: (see the paper for details)

sigma: Used to smooth the input image before segmenting it.
k: Value for the threshold function.
min: Minimum component size enforced by post-processing.
input: Input image.
output: Output image.

Typical parameters are sigma = 0.5, k = 500, min = 20.
Larger values for k result in larger components in the result.


Modification by Min
1/30:
Modified segment-image-opt.h from original segment-image.h
Mainly Modifying the segment_image() function

Add segmentImgOpt.cpp including the matlab interface mexFunction
Calling the segment_image() defined in segment-image-opt.h
